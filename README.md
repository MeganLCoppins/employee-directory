# Employee Directory

## Description

I created an employee directory, a React application, that allows you to view a company's entire employee directory in a table that includes the employees photo, name, email, phone number, and birthday. The user is able to search for an employee by name using the search bar as well as sort the list of employees alphabetically (A-Z or Z-A).
